---

Work requests allow any staff member — including those with the Requester role — to flag a maintenance issue or repair need. Admins and managers then review incoming requests and decide whether to convert them into formal work orders.

## How work requests flow

1. A staff member submits a work request describing the issue
2. An Admin or Manager reviews the request
3. If valid, the request is **converted to a work order** and assigned to a technician
4. If not needed, the request is **rejected** with a note explaining why

## Work request statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Submitted** | Request has been submitted, pending review |
| **Under Review** | Being assessed by a manager or admin |
| **Converted** | Converted into a work order |
| **Rejected** | Declined, with a reason provided |

<Note>
  All members can submit work requests. **Admins** and **Managers** can review and convert or reject them.
