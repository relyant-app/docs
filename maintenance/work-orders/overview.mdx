Work orders are the core of Relyant's maintenance management. A work order is a formal task assigned to a technician or team to complete a specific maintenance or repair job. Each work order tracks who is responsible, what needs to be done, the priority, and the current status.

## Work order statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Open** | Created but not yet started |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on |
| **On Hold** | Paused, waiting on parts or access |
| **Completed** | Work has been finished |
| **Cancelled** | Work order was cancelled before completion |

## Priority levels

| Priority | Use when |
|---|---|
| **Low** | Non-urgent, can be scheduled in normal course |
| **Medium** | Should be addressed within a few days |
| **High** | Urgent, needs attention within 24 hours |
| **Critical** | Emergency, requires immediate action |

<Note>
  **Required role:** **Admin** or **Manager** can create, assign, and close work orders. **Technicians** can view assigned orders and update their status.
