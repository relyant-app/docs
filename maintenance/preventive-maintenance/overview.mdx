Preventive maintenance (PM) in Relyant lets you create recurring maintenance schedules for assets and locations. Instead of waiting for equipment to fail, you proactively schedule regular servicing — and Relyant automatically generates the work orders on time.

## How it works

1. You create a PM schedule linked to an asset or location
2. You define the recurrence (e.g., every 3 months)
3. On the scheduled date, Relyant automatically creates a work order
4. The work order is assigned to the designated technician and follows the normal work order lifecycle

## PM schedule statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active** | Schedule is enabled and generating work orders |
| **Paused** | Schedule is temporarily disabled |
| **Completed** | Schedule has ended (for fixed-duration schedules) |

<Note>
  **Required role:** **Admin** or **Manager** to create and manage PM schedules.
