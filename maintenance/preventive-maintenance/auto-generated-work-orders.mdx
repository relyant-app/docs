When a PM schedule's scheduled date arrives, Relyant automatically creates a work order and assigns it to the designated technician. This page explains how that process works and how to manage auto-generated orders.

## How auto-generation works

1. On the scheduled date, Relyant generates a work order based on the PM schedule's details (title, description, category, assignee)
2. The work order appears in **Maintenance → Work Orders** with **Open** status
3. The assigned technician receives a notification
4. After the technician completes the work order, the next occurrence is scheduled automatically

## Finding auto-generated work orders

Auto-generated work orders are labelled with a **PM** badge in the Work Orders list. You can filter by **Source: Preventive Maintenance** to view only PM-generated orders.

## If a work order isn't completed on time

If an auto-generated work order isn't completed before the next occurrence is due, Relyant will:
- Keep the existing open work order
- Generate a new work order for the new occurrence
- Flag the overdue work order in the schedule's detail view

## Pausing or editing a schedule

If you need to temporarily stop generating work orders (e.g., during a school holiday), you can pause the schedule:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the schedule">
    In **Maintenance → Preventive Maintenance**, click the schedule.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pause or edit">
    Click **Pause** to temporarily stop work order generation, or **Edit** to change the schedule details or recurrence.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resume when ready">
    Click **Resume** to re-activate the schedule. The next work order will be generated based on the updated schedule.
  </Step>
</Steps>
