Locations in Relyant represent the physical spaces in your organization. They form a hierarchy — **Building → Floor → Room** — that lets you assign assets, work orders, and bookings to specific places.

## Location hierarchy

| Level | Example |
|---|---|
| **Building** | Main Campus, Science Block, Administration Building |
| **Floor** | Ground Floor, Level 1, Basement |
| **Room** | Room 101, Server Room, Gymnasium |

## Key concepts

- Assets are assigned to a location at any level (building, floor, or room)
- Work orders can reference a specific location
- Room bookings require locations set up at the room level

<Note>
  **Required role:** Viewing locations is available to all members. Creating, editing, and deleting locations requires the **Admin** or **Manager** role.
