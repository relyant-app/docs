  **Required role:** **Admin** or **Manager**
</Note>

Over time you may need to rename, reorganize, or remove locations as your campus changes. This guide covers how to manage your existing location structure.

## Edit a location

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the location">
    In the left sidebar, click **Locations**, then navigate to the building, floor, or room you want to edit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Edit">
    Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) on the location's detail page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the details">
    Change the name, address, capacity, or any other fields as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply your changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Delete a location

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the location">
    Navigate to the building, floor, or room you want to delete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Delete">
    Click the **Delete** button on the location's detail page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the deletion in the dialog. Note that you cannot delete a location that has assets or active bookings assigned to it — you'll need to reassign or remove those first.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notes

- Deleting a building also deletes all floors and rooms within it
- Deleted locations cannot be recovered — proceed with caution
- Assets assigned to a deleted location will have no location assigned
