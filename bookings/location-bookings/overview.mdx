Location bookings in Relyant let staff reserve rooms and spaces — classrooms, meeting rooms, gyms, labs, or any other bookable location. The booking system handles scheduling, conflict detection, and optional approval workflows.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Booking** | A reservation of a room for a specific date and time |
| **Booking type** | A category for bookings (e.g., Class, Meeting, Event) that can have different rules |
| **Capacity** | The maximum number of people a room can hold |
| **Setup/teardown** | Extra time before or after a booking for preparation and cleanup |
| **Conflict detection** | Automatic check that a room isn't double-booked |

## Booking statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | Submitted, awaiting approval (if approval workflow is enabled) |
| **Confirmed** | Approved and scheduled |
| **Cancelled** | Booking was cancelled |

<Note>
  All members can submit booking requests. **Admins** and **Managers** can approve, reject, and manage all bookings. Booking settings must be configured before rooms can be booked.
