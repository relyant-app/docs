<Note>
  **Required role:** **Admin** or **Manager** to configure setup/teardown defaults. All members can add setup/teardown when creating a booking.
</Note>

Setup and teardown tasks add buffer time around a booking — for example, 15 minutes before to arrange chairs and 10 minutes after to clean up. This time is blocked on the room's calendar so it can't be double-booked.

## Add setup/teardown to a booking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or open a booking">
    Go to **Bookings → Location Bookings** and create a new booking or open an existing one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable setup/teardown">
    Look for the **Setup** and **Teardown** fields in the booking form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the durations">
    Enter the time needed:
    - **Setup time** — minutes before the booking start (e.g., 15 minutes)
    - **Teardown time** — minutes after the booking end (e.g., 10 minutes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a task description (optional)">
    Describe what needs to happen during setup and teardown (e.g., "Arrange chairs in rows", "Return equipment to storage").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. The setup and teardown windows are now blocked on the room's calendar.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notes

- Setup and teardown time is included in conflict detection — a room won't be bookable during these windows
- Setup/teardown times can be included in reports for space utilization analysis
