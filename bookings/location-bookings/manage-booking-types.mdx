  **Required role:** **Admin** to create and manage booking types.

Booking types categorize your bookings (e.g., Class, Meeting, Event, Staff Training) and can have different rules — such as requiring approval or limiting booking duration.

    Click **Add Booking Type** and fill in:
    - **Name** — the type name (e.g., "Class", "Conference", "Event")
    - **Description** — a brief explanation of what this type is for
    - **Requires approval** — toggle on if bookings of this type need Admin or Manager approval
    - **Max duration** — the maximum length of a single booking (optional)
    - **Advance booking limit** — how far in advance bookings can be made (optional)
