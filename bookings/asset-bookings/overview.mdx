Asset bookings let staff reserve specific pieces of equipment — projectors, laptops, vehicles, cameras, or any other bookable asset — for a defined time period. Relyant tracks availability and prevents double-booking.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Asset booking** | A reservation of a specific asset for a date and time range |
| **Bookable asset** | An asset that has been enabled for booking in asset settings |
| **Capacity** | For assets that can serve multiple users (e.g., a set of 10 laptops), the number simultaneously available |
| **Availability** | Whether the asset is free during the requested time |

## Booking statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | Awaiting approval (if approval is required) |
| **Confirmed** | Approved and reserved |
| **Cancelled** | Booking was cancelled |

<Note>
  All members can request asset bookings. **Admins** and **Managers** approve bookings when approval is required. An asset must be marked as **bookable** in its settings before it can be reserved.
