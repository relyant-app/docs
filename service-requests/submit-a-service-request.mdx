Any Relyant member can submit a service request to ask for help or a service from your operations, IT, or facilities team.

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Service Requests">
    In the left sidebar, click **Service Requests**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click New Request">
    Click the **New Request** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a category and request type">
    Browse the available categories and select the request type that best matches what you need. For example:
    - **IT** → "Hardware Issue" for a broken device
    - **Facilities** → "Room Setup" for event preparation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the form">
    Each request type has its own form. Complete all required fields — these may include:
    - A description of your request
    - The location involved
    - Custom questions specific to the request type (e.g., "Which device is affected?")
    - Attachments (photos, documents)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit">
    Click **Submit**. Depending on the request type:
    - If **no approval** is required, the request moves directly to **In Progress**
    - If **approval** is required, the request moves to **Submitted** until an approver reviews it
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tracking your request

After submitting, you can track the status in **Service Requests → My Requests**. You'll receive notifications when the status changes or when the team leaves a comment.
