Service requests in Relyant provide a structured way for staff to request services from your team — IT support, facilities assistance, HR requests, or any other internal service. Unlike work requests (which are specifically for maintenance), service requests are customizable by type and category, and can have approval workflows.

## How service requests work

1. An Admin configures request types and categories
2. Staff members submit service requests using the configured types
3. The request is routed to the appropriate team based on the request type
4. The team reviews the request and takes action

## Service request statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Submitted** | Request has been submitted |
| **In Review** | Being assessed by the responsible team |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on |
| **Resolved** | Request has been completed |
| **Closed** | Closed by the requester or admin |
| **Rejected** | Declined, with a reason provided |

<Note>
  All members can submit service requests. **Admins** configure request types and approval workflows. **Managers** can manage incoming requests for their team.
