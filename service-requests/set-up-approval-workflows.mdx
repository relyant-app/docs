<Note>
  **Required role:** **Admin**
</Note>

Approval workflows let you require one or more approvals before a service request is acted on. This is useful for requests that involve resources, budget, or sensitive information.

## Enable approval for a request type

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the request type">
    In **Settings → Service Request Settings**, click the request type you want to configure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable approval">
    Toggle **Requires Approval** to on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select approvers">
    Choose who can approve requests of this type:
    - **Any Admin** — any Admin in your organization can approve
    - **Any Manager** — any Manager can approve
    - **Specific members** — select specific people by name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set approval rules">
    Choose the approval logic:
    - **Any one approver** — the request is approved when one person approves
    - **All approvers** — the request requires approval from everyone in the list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. New requests of this type will now require approval before they move to **In Progress**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How approval notifications work

When a request requiring approval is submitted:
1. All designated approvers receive a notification
2. Approvers can approve or reject from the notification or from the service requests list
3. Once the approval condition is met, the request moves to **In Progress** and the requester is notified
