Request types define the different kinds of services your team provides — for example, "IT Support", "Facilities Request", "HR Enquiry". Each request type can have its own form fields, assignee, category, and approval workflow.

## Create a request type

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    In the left sidebar, click **Settings**, then navigate to **Service Request Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a request type">
    Click **Add Request Type** and fill in:
    - **Name** — the name of the request type (e.g., "IT Support", "Room Setup")
    - **Description** — a brief explanation of what this type is for
    - **Category** — assign this type to a category (see [Manage Categories](/service-requests/manage-categories))
    - **Default assignee** — who receives and handles requests of this type (optional)
    - **Requires approval** — toggle on if requests need Admin or Manager approval before work begins
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add custom fields (optional)">
    Click **Add Field** to add custom questions that requesters must answer when submitting this type. For example, an IT Support request might ask "Which device is affected?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. The request type is now available when submitting a service request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Edit or deactivate a request type

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the request type">
    In **Settings → Service Request Settings**, click on an existing request type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit or deactivate">
    Click **Edit** to change the settings, or toggle **Active** off to hide this type from the submission form without deleting it.
  </Step>
</Steps>
