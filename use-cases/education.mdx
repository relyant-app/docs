Relyant was built with educational institutions in mind — whether you run a single school or a multi-campus university, it brings your facilities, assets, maintenance, and services into one place.

## Key challenges Relyant solves

Educational institutions face a unique mix of operational demands: aging infrastructure, high asset turnover, rotating staff, and the need to serve both students and administrators. Common pain points include:

- **Scattered asset records** — devices, lab equipment, and furniture tracked in spreadsheets or not at all
- **Reactive maintenance** — issues reported ad hoc, no structured workflow for prioritization or follow-up
- **Booking conflicts** — classrooms and shared equipment double-booked or unavailable when needed
- **Procurement bottlenecks** — purchase requests handled through email, approvals delayed
- **Lack of visibility** — no single view of what's broken, what's ordered, or what's scheduled
