description: "How property managers and building operators use Relyant to manage assets, tenants, and maintenance across their portfolio"
---

Commercial real estate operators manage multiple buildings, diverse tenant needs, and complex maintenance schedules — often with lean teams. Relyant centralizes property operations so nothing slips through the cracks.

## Key challenges Relyant solves

Property management involves coordinating across buildings, contractors, tenants, and vendors with a high volume of reactive and planned work. Common pain points include:

- **No single source of truth** — asset and maintenance data spread across spreadsheets, email, and paper
- **Reactive-only maintenance** — no preventive scheduling means higher repair costs and tenant complaints
- **Tenant request management** — requests arrive informally, are hard to track, and slow to resolve
- **Vendor and contractor management** — no structured way to track supplier relationships or POs
- **Portfolio visibility** — hard to see maintenance status or asset health across multiple properties at once

## Getting started

3. Register key building systems as [assets](/assets/add-an-asset) — HVAC units, elevators, generators, etc.
4. Set up [preventive maintenance schedules](/maintenance/preventive-maintenance/create-a-pm-schedule) for systems that require regular servicing.
