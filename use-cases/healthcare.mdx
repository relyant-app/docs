description: "How clinics, hospitals, and healthcare facilities use Relyant to manage equipment, maintenance, and operations"
---

Healthcare facilities operate in high-stakes environments where equipment availability and compliance aren't optional. Relyant gives facilities and biomedical teams the visibility and control they need to keep operations running safely.

## Key challenges Relyant solves

Managing a healthcare facility involves strict accountability for equipment, fast response to maintenance issues, and coordination across many departments. Common pain points include:

- **Equipment traceability** — medical devices and support equipment need reliable records of location, condition, and service history
- **Unplanned downtime** — equipment failures without preventive maintenance schedules lead to costly disruptions
- **Compliance gaps** — inspection and servicing records are hard to retrieve during audits
- **Work order chaos** — maintenance requests arrive through informal channels with no priority or tracking
- **Procurement delays** — supplies and parts need fast, accountable ordering processes
