description: "How hotels, resorts, and hospitality operators use Relyant to manage facilities, assets, and guest-facing operations"
---

In hospitality, every operational failure is visible to guests. Relyant helps hotels and resorts run tight maintenance programs, manage assets across properties, and coordinate teams so the guest experience is never compromised.

## Key challenges Relyant solves

Hospitality operations run around the clock, with high guest expectations and little tolerance for downtime. Common pain points include:

- **Equipment failures during peak periods** — without preventive schedules, breakdowns happen at the worst times
- **Scattered asset records** — FF&E (furniture, fixtures, and equipment) tracked inconsistently across departments
- **Slow maintenance response** — housekeeping and front desk report issues informally, repairs take days
- **Room and space booking conflicts** — event spaces and shared amenities double-booked or unavailable
- **Procurement inefficiency** — supplies ordered reactively without visibility into spend or vendor history
