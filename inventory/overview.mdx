Inventory in Relyant lets you track consumable items and supplies — spare parts, cleaning products, office materials, and anything else your team uses regularly. Members can submit item requests, and managers can fulfil them from current stock.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Item** | A trackable consumable or supply (e.g., printer toner, AA batteries) |
| **Stock level** | The current quantity on hand for an item |
| **Minimum stock** | A threshold that triggers a low-stock alert |
| **Item request** | A request from a team member to receive or use an inventory item |

## Item request statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | Submitted, awaiting review |
| **Approved** | Approved and being fulfilled |
| **Fulfilled** | Item has been issued to the requester |
| **Rejected** | Request was declined |

<Note>
  **Required role:** All members can submit item requests. Managing stock levels requires the **Admin** or **Manager** role.
