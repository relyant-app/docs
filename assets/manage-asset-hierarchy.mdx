Asset hierarchies let you group related assets together. For example, you can set a server rack as a parent asset and individual servers as child assets. This makes it easier to navigate and report on complex equipment.

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the asset">
    In the left sidebar, click **Assets**, then click the asset you want to assign a parent to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the asset">
    Click **Edit** on the asset detail page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the parent asset">
    In the **Parent Asset** field, search for and select the asset that should be the parent of this one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. The asset will now appear as a child of the selected parent in the hierarchy view.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing the hierarchy

On any asset's detail page, you can see:
- **Parent asset** — the asset this one belongs to
- **Child assets** — any assets that belong to this one

Use the hierarchy view in the Assets list to browse assets in a tree structure.
