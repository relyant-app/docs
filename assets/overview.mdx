description: "Track and manage all physical assets across your organization"
---

Assets in Relyant represent any physical item your organization wants to track — equipment, devices, vehicles, furniture, infrastructure, and more. Each asset has a profile with photos, location, category, custom fields, and a maintenance history.

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Asset** | A single trackable physical item |
| **Category** | A classification group for assets (e.g., HVAC, IT Equipment) |
| **Hierarchy** | Parent-child relationship between assets (e.g., a server rack containing individual servers) |
| **Location** | The building, floor, or room where the asset is physically located |
| **Barcode / QR** | A scannable identifier linked to an asset record |
| **Custom fields** | Additional data fields specific to your asset categories |

## Asset statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active** | In use and operational |
| **Inactive** | Not currently in use |
| **Under maintenance** | Currently being serviced or repaired |
| **Disposed** | Retired or removed from service |

<Note>
  **Required role:** Viewing assets is available to all members. Creating, editing, and deleting assets requires the **Admin** or **Manager** role.
