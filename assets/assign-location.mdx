Assigning a location to an asset makes it easy to find where equipment is physically located and enables location-based filtering in reports and work orders.

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the asset">
    In the left sidebar, click **Assets**, then click the asset you want to update.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the asset">
    Click **Edit** on the asset detail page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the location">
    In the **Location** section, select:
    - **Building** — the building where the asset is located
    - **Floor** — the floor within that building (optional)
    - **Room** — the specific room (optional)

    You can assign the asset at any level of the hierarchy. For example, you can assign it to just a building if the exact room isn't known.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to update the asset's location.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notes

- Locations must be set up before you can assign them. See [Add a Building](/locations/add-a-building) and [Add Floors and Rooms](/locations/add-floors-and-rooms).
- Changing an asset's location does not affect its maintenance history or work orders.
