## Asset Management Enhancements

- **Bulk QR Code Export** — You can now select multiple assets and export their QR codes as a single PDF, making it easier to print and label physical assets in bulk.
- **Custom Asset Fields** — Admins can now define custom fields on asset profiles to capture site-specific data not covered by default fields.

## Work Orders

- **Recurring Work Orders** — Schedule work orders to repeat on a daily, weekly, or monthly cadence directly from the work order creation form.
- **Improved Technician Assignment** — Reassigning a work order now sends an in-app notification to the newly assigned technician.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where filtering assets by location returned incomplete results when a location had sub-locations.
- Resolved a display bug where the asset status badge did not update immediately after a status change.

## Service Requests

- **Public Request Portal** — External users (e.g., tenants, students) can now submit service requests via a shareable link without needing a Relyant account.
- **Priority Labels** — Service requests now support Low, Medium, High, and Urgent priority labels to help teams triage incoming work.

## Inventory

- **Low Stock Alerts** — Set a minimum quantity threshold per inventory item. Relyant will notify your team when stock falls below the threshold.
- **Supplier Linking** — Inventory items can now be linked to a supplier record, making it faster to initiate a purchase request when restocking.

## Improvements

- The Members page now displays the last login date for each user to help admins audit account activity.
- Location pages load faster due to optimized data fetching for large location hierarchies.
