Purchase requests (PRs) are the first step in Relyant's procurement workflow. Before a purchase order is issued to a supplier, team members submit a purchase request describing what they need. Managers review and approve the request before it becomes a purchase order.

## How purchase requests flow

1. A team member submits a purchase request with the items needed
2. A Manager or Admin reviews and approves or rejects the request
3. If approved, the request can be converted into a purchase order

## Purchase request statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Draft** | Created but not yet submitted |
| **Submitted** | Awaiting approval |
| **Approved** | Approved and ready to convert to a PO |
| **Rejected** | Declined with a reason |
| **Converted** | Converted into a purchase order |

<Note>
  All members can submit purchase requests. **Admins** and **Managers** can approve, reject, and convert them to purchase orders.
