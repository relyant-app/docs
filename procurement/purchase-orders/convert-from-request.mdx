</Note>

The most common way to create a purchase order is to convert an approved purchase request. This pre-fills the PO with the request's items and details, reducing data entry.

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the purchase request">
    In **Procurement → Purchase Requests**, click on an **Approved** purchase request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Convert to PO">
    Click the **Convert to Purchase Order** button on the request detail page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the supplier">
    Choose the supplier to send the PO to. If a preferred supplier was noted in the request, it will be pre-selected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and update line items">
    Review the line items carried over from the request. Update:
    - **Unit price** — the confirmed price from the supplier's quote
    - **Quantity** — adjust if needed
    - **Description** — add product codes or SKUs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set delivery details">
    Enter:
    - **Expected delivery date** — when you expect to receive the goods
    - **Delivery address** — where the goods should be delivered
    - **Notes to supplier** — any special instructions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the PO">
    Click **Create Purchase Order**. The PO is saved in **Draft** status. You can review and edit it before sending it to the supplier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send to supplier">
    When ready, click **Send to Supplier**. The PO status changes to **Sent** and a PDF copy can be downloaded or emailed to the supplier.
  </Step>
</Steps>
