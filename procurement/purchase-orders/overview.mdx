Purchase orders (POs) are formal documents issued to suppliers authorizing the purchase of goods or services. Relyant tracks POs from creation through approval, delivery, and goods receipt.

## Purchase order lifecycle

1. **Create** — a PO is created (directly or converted from a purchase request)
2. **Send to supplier** — the PO is issued to the supplier
3. **Receive goods** — items arrive and are logged in a goods receipt
4. **Close** — the PO is closed once all items are received

## Purchase order statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Draft** | Created but not yet sent |
| **Sent** | Issued to the supplier |
| **Partially Received** | Some items have been received |
| **Received** | All items have been received |
| **Closed** | PO is complete |
| **Cancelled** | PO was cancelled |

<Note>
  **Required role:** **Admin** or **Manager** to create and manage purchase orders.
