When goods from a purchase order are delivered, you record the receipt in Relyant. This updates the PO status and can automatically update inventory stock levels.

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the purchase order">
    In **Procurement → Purchase Orders**, click the PO with **Sent** status that the delivery corresponds to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Receive Goods">
    Click the **Receive Goods** button on the PO detail page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter receipt details">
    A goods receipt form will open with the PO's line items. For each item:
    - **Quantity received** — enter how many units arrived (can be less than ordered if delivery is partial)
    - **Condition** — note if any items arrived damaged (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the receipt date">
    Confirm or update the delivery date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add notes (optional)">
    Add any notes about the delivery (e.g., "3 units arrived damaged", "Delivery included a packing slip").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save Receipt**. Relyant will:
    - Update the PO status to **Partially Received** or **Received**
    - Create a goods receipt record (see [Goods Receipts](/procurement/purchase-orders/goods-receipts))
    - Update inventory stock levels for linked inventory items
  </Step>
