Members are the people in your Relyant organization. Each member has a role that controls what they can see and do. The Members section lets Owners and Admins manage the team — invite new members, change roles, and remove access when needed.

## Roles and permissions

| Role | Key permissions |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Full access including billing and organization deletion |
| **Admin** | Full access to all modules; can manage members and settings |
| **Manager** | Create and manage work orders, bookings, procurement; can view reports |
| **Technician** | View and update assigned work orders |
| **Requester** | Submit work requests and service requests; view assigned items |

<Note>
  **Required role:** Only **Owners** and **Admins** can invite, update, or remove members.
