When a staff member leaves or no longer needs access to Relyant, you can remove them from the organization. Their data (work orders, requests, etc.) will remain in the system but they will no longer be able to log in.

## Steps

  <Step title="Go to Members">
    In the left sidebar, click **Members**.

  <Step title="Find the member">
    Search for or scroll to the member you want to remove.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open member options">
    Click on the member's name to open their profile, or click the three-dot menu (⋮) next to their name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Remove">
    Click **Remove Member** or **Revoke Access**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the action in the dialog. The member will be logged out immediately and will no longer be able to access your organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notes

- All data they created (work orders, notes, etc.) remains in the system
- Pending invitations can be cancelled from the **Pending** tab without going through this process
