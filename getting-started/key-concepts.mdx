Understanding these concepts will help you navigate Relyant and set up your organization effectively.

## Organization

Your **organization** is the top-level container for all your data in Relyant. Everything — assets, locations, members, work orders — belongs to a single organization. When you sign up, you create or join an organization.

## Roles

Relyant uses role-based access control. Each member is assigned one of the following roles:

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Full access to all settings, billing, and member management |
| **Admin** | Full access to all modules; can manage members and settings |
| **Manager** | Can create and manage work orders, bookings, and procurement |
| **Technician** | Can view and update assigned work orders |
| **Requester** | Can submit work requests and service requests |

## Assets

An **asset** is any physical item your organization wants to track — a piece of equipment, a device, a vehicle, a room fixture, etc. Assets can be organized into categories, assigned to locations, and linked to maintenance records.

## Locations

**Locations** represent the physical spaces in your organization. They follow a hierarchy: **Building → Floor → Room**. Assets and bookings are linked to locations.

## Work Orders

A **work order** is a formal task assigned to a technician or team to complete a specific maintenance or repair job. Work orders have statuses, priorities, due dates, and can include files and notes.

## Work Requests

A **work request** is an informal maintenance request submitted by any user. Admins or managers review work requests and can convert them into formal work orders.

## Preventive Maintenance

**Preventive maintenance (PM)** schedules are recurring maintenance tasks tied to assets or locations. Relyant automatically generates work orders based on your defined schedule and recurrence rules.

## Bookings

A **booking** reserves a location or asset for a specific time period. Bookings can have types, approval workflows, and setup/teardown tasks.
