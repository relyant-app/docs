This guide walks you through the end-to-end setup process — from creating your organization to configuring your first assets, locations, and team.

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your organization">
    Sign up at [app.relyant.app](https://app.relyant.app) and create your organization. You'll be prompted to enter a name and organization type.

    [Create your organization →](/getting-started/create-your-organization)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your locations">
    Add your buildings, floors, and rooms so assets and work orders can be tied to a physical space.

    [Add a building →](/locations/add-a-building)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your assets">
    Register the equipment, furniture, and infrastructure your team manages. Assign each asset to a location and category.

    [Add an asset →](/assets/add-an-asset)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invite your team">
    Invite staff and assign roles (Admin, Manager, Technician, or Requester) so everyone has the right level of access.

    [Invite your team →](/getting-started/invite-your-team)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the setup checklist">
    Use the quick setup checklist to confirm you haven't missed anything before going live.
